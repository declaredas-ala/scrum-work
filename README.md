Sprint Planning

During the Sprint Planning meeting, the Scrum team will meet with the Product Owner to review the Product Backlog and select the items to be completed during the upcoming sprint. The team will then work together to break down those items into smaller, actionable tasks and estimate the amount of work required to complete each task. The team will then commit to completing those tasks during the upcoming sprint.

For our example project, the Sprint Planning might look something like this:

Sprint Goal: Develop a web application that collects client information, stores it in a database, and scrapes additional information from a specified website.

Selected Product Backlog Items:

Write a form using HTML/CSS to collect client information
Create a database to store client information, including email, description, and website
Create a Flask backend to handle form submissions and database storage
Write a Python script to scrape additional information from the specified website
Deploy the application to a domain server
Tasks:

Design wireframes for the form layout
Write HTML/CSS code for the form
Write JavaScript code to validate form inputs
Create a SQL database schema for storing client information
Implement database connection and querying logic in Flask
Write tests to ensure form submission and database storage are working correctly
Write the Python script to scrape data from the specified website
Integrate the web scraping script into the Flask backend
Write tests to ensure web scraping functionality is working correctly
Configure and deploy the application to a domain server
Test the deployed application to ensure all functionality is working correctly
Sprint Backlog

During the Sprint, the team will work on completing the selected Product Backlog items by completing the following tasks:

Week 1:

Write JavaScript code to validate form inputs
Week 2:

Create a SQL database schema for storing client information
Implement database connection and querying logic in Flask

Sprint Review

At the end of the Sprint, the team will demo the completed functionality to the Product Owner and stakeholders to ensure the Sprint Goal was met. Feedback will be gathered to determine if any changes are necessary for the next Sprint. The team will also conduct a Sprint Retrospective to review the Sprint and identify areas for improvement in the next Sprint.
